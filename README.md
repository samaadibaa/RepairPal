Explain your models and integration with the inventory
microservice, here.

## Sales microservice

I created APIs for managing sales records, including salespeople, customers, and individual sales allowing you to Create, Update, Delete api_sales_person, api_customer, api_sales, api_list_sales. After setting up the models, views, and URLs, I shifted my focus to the front-end of the project. Here, I created the required forms and lists that would be displayed on the web application. Unfortunatly, I was not able to get SalesHistoryList to work correctly. I added navigation links to Nav.js and created routes in App.js to help user navigation.
